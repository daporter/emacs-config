SX is a full featured Stack Exchange mode for GNU Emacs 24+.  Using the official
API, it provides a versatile experience for the Stack Exchange network within
Emacs itself.

* Features
** Viewing Questions
View questions with one of the ~sx-tab-~ commands.  These translate to the
different 'tabs' that you can view on the official site.  Implemented tabs
include:

- ~sx-tab-all-questions~      :: All questions.
- ~sx-tab-unanswered~         :: Unanswered questions.
- ~sx-tab-unanswered-my-tags~ :: Unanswered questions in your followed tags.
- ~sx-tab-featured~           :: Featured questions.
- ~sx-tab-starred~            :: Your starred questions.

Each of these opens up a list of questions, and you can further customize the
ordering of the list with =O=.  Other keys include:

- =s s= :: Switch site.
- =n= and =p= :: Navigate the list.
- =j= and =k= :: Navigate while viewing the question in a separate buffer.
- =v= :: Visit the thing-at-point in your browser
- =w= :: Copy the thing-at-point (usually a link).
- =u= and =d= :: Upvote and downvote.
- =RET= :: Open the question buffer.

As always, =C-h m= is the definitive resource for the functions of this mode.

* Installation
SX is now available on MELPA!  Both the stable release and the development
version can be found there.  Install it via the Package Menu or just run
#+BEGIN_SRC text
M-x package-install RET sx RET=
#+END_SRC

If you are going to be doing any asking / answering / commenting / upvoting /
downvoting / /etc./, you must use ~sx-authenticate~ to provide SX with an
authentication token to act on your behalf.

** Icons
SX has no explicit /need/ for an icon, although standard SVG files
have been gathered in =resources/= if anyone would fancy a crack at
it.
