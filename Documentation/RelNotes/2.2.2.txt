Magit v2.2.2 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

This is a bugfix release.

* `magit-toplevel' did not follow symlinks to subdirectories of
  repositories.  #2135 #2209

* `magit-diff-wash-diff' choked on unmerged binary files.  #2211

* `magit-blame-popup' did not allow empty input when reading a value
  for "-C" or "-M".  #2208

* The `emacsclient' executables belonging to non-current alternative
  installations of Emacs on Debian were not considered when setting
  the default value of `with-editor-emacsclient-executable'.  #2217

* `server-edit', which switches to a buffer preferably one with
  another client, was used when finishing or aborting a `with-editor'
  session.  When `emacsclient' was used to connect to a server and
  then a commit or rebase was invoked, then there would be another
  client and switching to its buffer after finishing the commit or
  rebase would be undesirable.  Now we use `server-done' instead.
  #2197

* When `--stat' abbreviates the name of a file, then that name was
  stored in the section object instead of the full name.  #2199

* `magit-file-relative-name' with non-nil TRACKED failed in Tramp
  repositories.  #2206

* After failing to clone, `magit-clone' also tried to show the status
  of the non-existent clone.  #2203

This release also contains various documentation fixes.
